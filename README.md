# Refractive-Index-Prediction
The refractive index is an important property of a
material that is used in a variety of industries. It is a
measure of the material's ability to bend light, and
is used in a variety of applications where the
transmission and manipulation of light is
important.
Refractive Index (RI) can be defined as the ratio of
the velocity of light in a vacuum to the speed of
light in a material. Many materials have a wellcharacterized refractive index, but these indexes
often depend strongly upon the frequency of light,
causing optical dispersion. RI influences light
scattering and is weakly dependent on
temperature, pressure/stress, etc.,on precise
material compositions (presence of dopants etc.);
for many materials.
My solution aims to predict the Refractive
index of different crystals of various oxide
materials through Machine Learning Approach.
